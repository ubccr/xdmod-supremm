# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  An available Open XDMoD enhancement is SUPReMM (integrated HPC systems usage
  and performance of resources monitoring and modeling), which queries system
  hardware counters to collect a range of performance information, including
  memory usage, filesystem usage, interconnect fabric traffic, and CPU
  performance.
