The PCP software should be installed on each compute node and configured so
that data are collected:

* At the start of every job
* 10, 20 and 30 seconds after job start
* Periodically during the job (recommended 30 seconds)
* At the end of every job

The archive data for each node are stored on a shared filesystem for
subsequent processing by the job summarization software.

Install the PCP data collector on the compute nodes
-------------------------------------------

The PCP software has been included in the official CentOS packages since CentOS 7.6. Builds
for other distributions (and earlier CentOS versions) are available from the
[official PCP dowload page](https://pcp.io/download.html),

The CentOS RPM packages of the summarization software are tested against the version of PCP
that is provided with CentOS (This is PCP version 4.3.2 as of CentOS 7.8).

For an RPM based install on CentOS 7 the following command will install PCP with
all of the associated PMDAS (monitoring plugins) that have been tested with the
summarization software:

    # yum install pcp \
                  pcp-manager \
                  pcp-conf \
                  pcp-libs \
                  python-pcp \
                  perl-PCP-PMDA \
                  pcp-system-tools \
                  pcp-pmda-gpfs \
                  pcp-pmda-lustre \
                  pcp-pmda-infiniband \
                  pcp-pmda-mic \
                  pcp-pmda-nvidia-gpu \
                  pcp-pmda-nfsclient \
                  pcp-pmda-perfevent \
                  pcp-pmda-json

For a source code install follow the instructions on the [official PCP site](https://pcp.io/docs/installation.html).

Note that the node that runs the summarization software does not need to have all of the
PCP data collection components installed. It only requires the python pcp libraries.

Compatibility notes
-------------------

The summarization software is tested on CentOS 7 with the package versions of PCP that
are supplied with CentOS 7. In general any version of PCP will work as long as the
summarization software is built against the same or newer version of PCP as the version
installed on the compute nodes.
