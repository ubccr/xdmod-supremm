title: Job Summarization Software Requirements
---

The Job Summarization software requires the following packages:

* [python][] 2.7
    * [numpy][]
    * [MySQL]
    * [scipy][]
    * [pymongo][]
* [pcp][] >= 3.11.0

[python]:         http://python.org
[numpy]:          http://www.numpy.org/
[MySQL]:          https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python
[scipy]:          http://www.scipy.org/
[pymongo]:        https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/python/
[pcp]:            http://pcp.io

The data generated by the software is stored in a MongoDB instance. See the [MongoDB install instructions](supremm-mongo.html) for details on this.

Linux Distribution Packages
---------------------------

The Job Summarization software has been tested on Centos 7, but will likely run on most
recent Linux distributions.

For Centos, the software requirements can be met using packages from the EPEL
repository and using the packages provided by the PCP project.

The PCP project dependencies can be setup using the instructions on [their
package site](https://bintray.com/pcp/el7/pcp/3.11.4/) under the "Set Me Up"
link.

**NOTE**: The package lists below includes packages included with
[EPEL](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).  This repository can be
added with this command for CentOS:

    # yum install epel-release

### CentOS 7

Install the required dependencies:

    # yum install python-pymongo numpy scipy MySQL-python pcp-libs pcp
