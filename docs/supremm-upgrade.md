title: SUPReMM Open XDMoD module Upgrade Guide
---

General Upgrade Notes
---------------------

The Job Performance (SUPReMM) XDMoD module should be upgraded at the same time as the main XDMoD
software. The upgrade procedure is documented on the [XDMoD upgrade
page](https://open.xdmod.org/upgrade.html). Downloads of RPMs and source
packages for the Job Performance (SUPReMM) XDMoD module are available from
[GitHub][github-latest-release]. The ingestion and aggregation
script `aggregate_supremm.sh` **must** be run after the XDMoD software has been
upgraded.

Note that if you edited the `application.json` file you will need to re-apply
these edits every time you upgrade as noted on [this page](customization.md).

11.0.0 Upgrade Notes
--------------------

### Configuration File Changes

The upgrade script will update the following configuration files:

- `application.json` to add the MOM6, ROMS, NEXMD, Libra, DFTB+, and CDO
  applications.
- `efficiency_analytics.json` to remove the deprecated `rotate` setting and to
  update the Short Job Count analytic to use a new `short_job_count` statistic.

### Database Changes

The upgrade script will add rows to the `modw_supremm.application` table for
the MOM6, ROMS, NEXMD, Libra, DFTB+, and CDO applications.
