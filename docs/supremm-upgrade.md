General Upgrade Notes
---------------------

The Job Performance (SUPReMM) XDMoD module should be upgraded at the same time as the main XDMoD
software. The upgrade procedure is documented on the [XDMoD upgrade
page](https://open.xdmod.org/upgrade.html).  The ingestion and aggregation
script `aggregate_supremm.sh` **must** be run after the XDMoD software has been
upgraded.
