title: Install MongoDB
---

A MongoDB server must be installed and enabled. We recommend that the software 
is installed on a dedicated server, however it may be installed on the same
server as the XDMoD instance.

Please refer to the official [MongoDB installation manual](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) for instructions on how to install MongoDB.

The MongoDB node.js driver used in the Job Performance (SUPREMM) XDMoD module is compatible with MongoDB 2.6, 3.0, 3.2 and 3.4. The software has been tested against MongoDB version 3.4
