title: Customization

This document describes some advanced customizations for the Job Performance module.

**The automated upgrade scripts do not have any support for preserving
customizations. Any changes made to the underlying Open XDMoD source code
will likely be overwritten when the software is upgraded.**

## Job Analytics

The job analytics panel shows selected job performance metrics in color
coded plots across the top of the job tab in the Job Viewer. The value of
each metric in the panel is normalized so a value near 1 means a favourable
value and a value near 0 indicates an unfavourable value.

There are five default analytics. These are the CPU Usage,
Homogeneity, CPU Balance, Memory Efficiency, and Walltime Accuracy, see Figure 1
below. If the CPU Usage metric is unavailable then the analytics toolbar is not displayed.
If any of the other metrics are unavailable then an error message is displayed.

</figure>

A common reason why an analytic is unavailable is that the underlying data was not collected
when the job was running. For example, the homogeneity analytic uses the L1D load count and
CPU clock tick counter hardware counter data. If the hardware counter data were not configured
to be collected or the hardware does not support a L1D load counter then the homogeneity
metric will be unavailable. An example of the display in this case is shown in Figure 2.

The metric display shows an exclamation mark icon with the text 'Metric Missing: Not Available On The Compute Nodes'" />

If an analytic will always be unavailable (for example, due to the absence of
hardware support), then the Open XDMoD instance can be customized to never show it.

**This customization will not be preserved if the Open XDMoD software is updated.**

**These instructions only apply to Open XDMoD {{ page.sw_version }}. For other
versions please refer to the documentation for that release.**

To remove an analytic you need to edit `/usr/share/xdmod/etl/js/config/supremm/etl.schema.js`
and remove the code associated with the analytic. For example to remove the homogeneity
analytic you would remove (or comment out) lines 2716â€“2732.  The lines to remove are shown below.
```js
2716             homogeneity: {
2717                 name: 'Homogeneity',
2718                 formula: '(1.0 - (1.0 / (1.0 + 1000.0 * jf.catastrophe)))',
2719                 withError: {
2720                     name: 'homogeneity_error',
2721                     column: 'catastrophe',
2722                     tableAlias: 'je'
2723                 },
2724                 unit: 'ratio',
2725                 per: 'job',
2726                 visibility: 'public',
2727                 comments: 'A measure of how uniform the L1D load rate is over the lifetime of the job. ' +
2728                     'Jobs with a low homogeneity value (~0) should be investigated to check if there ' +
2729                     'has been a catastrophic failure during the job',
2730                 batchExport: true,
2731                 dtype: 'analysis'
2732             },
```

After editing the file, run:
```
# node /usr/share/xdmod/etl/js/etl.cli.js -i
```

To change the order in which the analytics appear in the toolbar, edit the
`metricOrder` variable in `/usr/share/xdmod/html/gui/js/modules/job_viewer/JobPanel.js`.
