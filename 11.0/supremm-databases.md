title: SUPReMM Database Guide
---

The SUPReMM package installs two additional database schemas.

### modw_supremm

This schema contains the job-level information that has been ingested
into Open XDMoD.

### modw_etl

This schema contains a table that stores the results of each ingest of
SUPReMM data. These log data can be used for debugging and performance
analysis of the ingest process.
