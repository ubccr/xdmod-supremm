This guide explains how to configure the Job Performance (SUPReMM) XDMoD module.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that [Open XDMoD](http://open.xdmod.org) is installed and configured
correctly and the [shredder](http://open.xdmod.org/shredder.html) and
[ingestor](http://open.xdmod.org/ingestor.html) scripts have been run
successfully before configuring the SUPReMM module.  **Do not begin the
configuration steps until the accounting data is loaded into XDMoD**.

Double check that that the `timezone` and `shared_jobs` configuration settings
in the `resources.json` configuration file are correct for the resources that have performance data. These settings are
documented in the [main configuration guide](https://open.xdmod.org/{% if page.version %}{{page.version}}/{% endif %}configuration.html#resourcesjson)
The `timezone` setting determines the timezone of time data displayed in the XDMoD Job Viewer tab. The
`shared_jobs` setting determines whether the accounting data will be processed to check
for jobs that share compute nodes.

## Configuration

The Job Performance (SUPReMM) XDMoD module adds an additional main menu item
to the XDMoD interactive setup software. Run the script as follows:

    # xdmod-setup

and select the 'SUPReMM' option in the main menu. The `xdmod-setup` script usage is described below.

The next step after configuring in the XDMoD module is to install and configure the [job summarization software](supremm-processing-install.md).

The `xdmod-setup` script
------------------------

`xdmod-setup` is an interactive setup script for XDMoD. After installing the xdmod-supremm module, there will be an
additional option titled  "SUPReMM" in the main menu.  Select that option to show the SUPReMM
module configuration menu. The options in the menu are listed below:

### Setup database

This option creates the necessary SUPReMM-module specific database schemas
and tables in the XDMoD datawarehouse. You will
need to provide the credentials for your MySQL root user, or another
user that has privileges to create databases.  Two database schemas will be
created, `modw_etl` and `modw_supremm`.  The database user that is
specified in your `portal_settings.ini` will be granted access to these
databases.

The script also prompts for the location of the document database that
contains the job summary data. I.e. the MongoDB instance. Enter the uri
in the standard MongoDB connection string format (see the [mongo documentation][] for
the syntax).  **You must specify the database name in the connection URI.** If
the database is not specified then the MongoDB driver defaults to the 'test'
database, which will not contain the job summary data. The default database name is 'supremm'
so, for example, if you have installed the MongoDB on the same server as XDMoD then you would use
the following uri:

    mongodb://localhost:27017/supremm

The script also runs the `acl-config` command that is used to update the access controls in
XDMoD.  If you prefer to run this command manually use the following command

    # acl-config

The `acl-config` command is documented in the [XDMoD command reference][commands].

### Configure resources

The setup script automatically detects the existing resources in the XDMoD datawarehouse and lists them.
If no "Edit resource" options show in the list then quit the setup and complete the steps listed in the
[shredder][] and [ingestor][] guides before re-running the setup script.

By default all the resources are disabled. You must select the "Edit
resource" option for each resource that you wish to configure to appear in the
SUPReMM realm and follow the prompt to enable the resource and set the correct
options. The "Dataset mapping" should be set to 'pcp' if processing job summaries
generated from PCP data and 'prometheus' if processing job summaries generated
from Prometheus data.

SUPReMM configuration files
---------------------------

The SUPReMM module configuration files are located in the `etc` directory of
the installation prefix or `/etc/xdmod` for the RPM distribution.

### supremm_resources.json

Defines all of the resources that have Job Performance data that will be ingested and
displayed in XDMoD. Each object in the array represents the configuration for a
single resource. All resources listed in this file must also have entries in
the `resources.json` and `resource_specs.json` main configuration files
(described in the [main configuration guide](http://open.xdmod.org/configuration.html)).

```json
{
    "resources": [
        {
            "resource": "resource1",
            "resource_id": 1,
            "enabled": true,
            "datasetmap": "supremm",
            "hardware": {
                "gpfs": "gpfs0",
                "network": [
                    "em1",
                    "eno1"
                ],
                "mounts": {
                   "projects": "/projects",
                   "home": "/user",
                   "util": "/util"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The value of the `resource` parameter should be identical to the `resource`
parameter in the `resources.json` main configuration file.

The value of the `resource_id` must be the id of the resource in the XDMoD
datawarehouse. This value is obtained automatically by the interactive setup
script. It can be manually obtained by running the following SQL query:

```sql
mysql> SELECT id FROM `modw`.`resourcefact` WHERE code = "%resource%";
```

where `%resource%` should be replaced with the `resource` parameter from the
`resources.json` main configuration file.

The `datasetmap` option allows the ingestion of Job Performance data from different
data sources. Currently PCP and Prometheus are the only supported data sources.

The `hardware` property is used by the dataset mapping code to process
metrics that have device-specific names. There are configurable mappings
for Ethernet network devices, GPFS devices and mounted NFS filesystems.
The XDMoD statistics for each mapping setting is displayed in the table below.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Configuration Property</th> <th>XDMoD Statistics</th> <th>XDMoD Group Bys</th> <th>Job Viewer Summary tab statistics</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr> <td><code>hardware.gpfs</code></td><td>"Average gpfs receive rate", "Average gpfs transmit rate"</td><td>"GPFS bytes received"</td><td>Parallel filesystem gpfs &ast;"</td></tr>
<tr> <td><code>hardware.network</code></td><td>"Average eth0 receive rate", "Average eth0 transmit rate"</td><td> </td><td>"Net Eth0 &ast;"</td></tr>
<tr> <td><code>hardware.mounts.projects</code></td><td>"Avg /projects write rate"</td><td></td><td>"Mount point "projects" data &ast;"</td></tr>
<tr> <td><code>hardware.mounts.home</code></td><td>"Avg /home write rate"</td><td></td><td>"Mount point "home" data &ast;"</td></tr>
<tr> <td><code>hardware.mounts.util</code></td><td>"Avg /util write rate"</td><td></td><td>"Mount point "util" data &ast;"</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />

The mapping allows multiple modes of operation. The mapping software
can compute the sum of all the statistics collected from the devices.
It can also be given a list of device names in priority order and will
use the statistics from the first device that is found. This feature
is particularly useful for heterogeneous clusters.
The list below describes the appropriate value to set in the configuration
file for a given scenario.

- Specify the name of the device as reported by the O/S on the compute nodes.
- Specify an empty string if the device is absent or you do not wish the
  data to appear in XDMoD.
- Specify the string `all` if you would like the metric in XDMoD to be the
  sum of all of the detected devices on the compute nodes.
- Specify a list of device names. The mapping software will use the first device
  name in the list that is present in the summary statistics for each job.


#### Examples

An example hardware configuration setting is shown below:
```json
    "hardware": {
        "gpfs": "gpfs0.example.edu",
        "network": [
            "em1",
            "eno1"
        ],
        "mounts": {
           "projects": "/projects",
           "home": "/user",
           "util": "/util"
        }
    }
```
In this example the mapping would work as follows:
- The various XDMoD GPFS parallel filesystem statistics would be based on the GPFS filesystem `gpfs0.example.edu` mounted on the compute nodes.
- The various XDMoD Ethernet statistics would be based on the data read from and written to the `em1` device on compute nodes that had an `em1` Ethernet device and `eno1` for compute
nodes that did not have an `em1` device but did have an `eno1` device.
- The XDMoD `projects` filesystem statistics would be from the statistics collected from the NFS filesystem mounted at `/projects` on the compute nodes.
- The XDMoD `home` filesystem statistics would be from the statistics collected from the NFS filesystem mounted at `/user` on the compute nodes.
- The XDMoD `util` filesystem statistics would be from the statistics collected from the NFS filesystem mounted at `/util` on the compute nodes.

```json
    "hardware": {
        "gpfs": "all",
        "network": "eth1"
    }
```
In this example the mapping would work as follows:
- The various XDMoD GPFS parallel filesystem statistics would be based on sum of the statistics for all of the mounted GPFS filesystems.
- The various XDMoD Ethernet statistics would be based on the data read from and written to the `eth1` device on compute nodes.
- No data would be stored in XDMoD for NFS filesystems.


### portal_settings.d/supremm.ini

Contains the configuration settings to allow XDMoD to connect to the job summary document
database. The only supported db_engine is MongoDB.

```ini
[jobsummarydb]

db_engine = "MongoDB"
uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/supremm"
db = "supremm"
```

The uri syntax is described in the [mongo documentation][]. **You must specify
the database name in the connection URI.** If the database is not specified then
the MongoDB driver defaults to the 'test' database, which will not contain the
job summary data.

Advanced Configuration Options
---------------------------

The resource configuration file `supremm_resources.json` has optional advanced
configuration settings for each resource.

The `$.resources[*].collection` option overrides the collection name in the
MongoDB. This option can be used to set a non default collection name.

The `$.resources[*].db` option specifies the name of the section in the
portal_settings file that contains the database configuration settings. This
setting can be used to support an XDMoD instance ingesting data from multiple
MongoDB databases.
