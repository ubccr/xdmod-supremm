The performance data realm in XDMoD relies on performance
data collected from the compute nodes on a computational
resource.  The performance data collection software
should typically beinstalled on every compute node on a
resource.

The data collectors that can currently be used with Open XDMoD are Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) and Prometheus.
Only **one** data collector should be installed on the compute nodes.
