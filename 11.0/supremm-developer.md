The SUPReMM architecture comprises three major components.
   
* Software that runs directly on HPC compute nodes and periodically collects performance information.
* Software that uses the node-level performance data to generate job-level data.
* An Open XDMoD module that enables the job-level information to be viewed and analysed.

The Open XDMoD module is designed to support the ingestion and display of job-level performance data
from a variety of sources including [PCP](http://pcp.io), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), Cray RUR, and [tacc_stats](https://github.com/TACC/tacc_stats).
The recommended data collection software is either PCP or Prometheus. The supported job summarization software is listed below.
