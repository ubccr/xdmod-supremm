2017-01-10 v6.5.0
-----------------

**Important Note**: This update adds a dependency to npm. If you are updating
an existing installation via RPM, you will need to reinstall npm
dependencies afterward. To do this, run the commands below.

```bash
# Assuming XDMoD's share directory is RPM default "/usr/share/xdmod"

cd /usr/share/xdmod/etl/js
npm install
```

- Features
    - General
        - Added peak memory usage metric.
        - Improved application identification data.
        - Added aggregation data removal to the data reset script.
        - Added ability to track metrics for a "projects" filesystem.
    - Job Viewer
        - Added a count column to the detailed metrics pane to show how many
          data points were used to calculate the metrics.
    - Node ETL
        - Added support for uppercase auto-generated labels.
- Bug Fixes
    - Job Viewer
        - Fixed "Show Raw Data" button in Metric Explorer not filtering results
          correctly when using some combinations of drilldowns and filters.
        - Fixed single-point datasets not appearing in exported charts.
        - Fixed Search History tree sorting nodes that should not be sorted.
        - Fixed "Show Raw Data" window in Metric Explorer staying active after
          the chart underneath it changes (for example, when a new chart is
          imported from Usage).
        - Improved handling of raw data specified in kilobytes and megabytes
          in Detailed Metrics pane.
        - Fixed handling of Search History entries that have numeric names.
    - Node ETL
        - Fixed ingestion process hanging indefinitely if it failed to
          connect to the Mongo database at certain points.
        - Fixed SQL statement queue sometimes batching more statements
          together in one MySQL driver call than the driver can handle.
- Refactors and Miscellaneous
    - Spun this module out from the Open XDMoD repository.
        - Note that although the Job Viewer and Node ETL is part of Open XDMoD,
          changes will continued to be tracked as part of SUPReMM as long as it
          is the only user of both.
        - Also note that the Job Viewer is included with Open XDMoD install
          packages, whereas the Node ETL is included with SUPReMM packages.
    - Moved to custom option parser that supports long options and
      multi-character short options.
        - This replaces minimist and removes it as a dependency.

        - Fixed case where timeseries chart drilldowns performed on a chart were
          not reflected in the navigation tree.
        - Fixed case where selecting a low-level timeseries chart in the
