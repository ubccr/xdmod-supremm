The integration test framework is designed to be used to run tests against
an installed and working XDMoD instance.

The test harness in the xdmod repository must be configured correctly as
per the instructions in the readme file: xdmod/open_xdmod/modules/xdmod/integration_tests/README.md

Run the tests with ./runtests.sh
