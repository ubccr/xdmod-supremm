- Important Notes
    - This update adds a dependency to npm. If you are updating from a previous
      version installed via RPM, you will need to reinstall npm dependencies
      afterward. From the `etl/js` directory inside the XDMoD share directory
      (RPM default: `/usr/share/xdmod`), run `npm install`.
- Features
    - General
        - Added peak memory usage metric.
        - Improved application identification data.
        - Added aggregation data removal to the data reset script.
        - Added ability to track metrics for a "projects" filesystem.
    - Job Viewer
        - Added a count column to the detailed metrics pane to show how many
          data points were used to calculate the metrics.
    - Node ETL
        - Added support for uppercase auto-generated labels.
- Bug Fixes
    - Job Viewer
        - Fixed "Show Raw Data" button in Metric Explorer not filtering results
          correctly when using some combinations of drilldowns and filters.
        - Fixed single-point datasets not appearing in exported charts.
        - Fixed Search History tree sorting nodes that should not be sorted.
        - Fixed "Show Raw Data" window in Metric Explorer staying active after
          the chart underneath it changes (for example, when a new chart is
          imported from Usage).
        - Improved handling of raw data specified in kilobytes and megabytes
          in Detailed Metrics pane.
        - Fixed handling of Search History entries that have numeric names.
    - Node ETL
        - Fixed ingestion process hanging indefinitely if it failed to
          connect to the Mongo database at certain points.
        - Fixed SQL statement queue sometimes batching more statements
          together in one MySQL driver call than the driver can handle.
- Refactors and Miscellaneous
    - Moved to custom option parser that supports long options and
      multi-character short options.
        - This replaces minimist and removes it as a dependency.
