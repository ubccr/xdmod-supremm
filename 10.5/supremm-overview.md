This documentation is intended to be used by system administrators to install and configure
the generation and display of Job Performance data in XDMoD. If you are an end user looking for
help using XDMoD, the starting point is the 'Help' button on right hand side of the top toolbar
in the web interface.

If you are intending to do a fresh install of the software then the starting point is
to review the [Software licensing information](supremm-notices.md), read the 
[Architecture guide](supremm-architecture.md) and the [Install overview](supremm-install-overview.md).

The [Upgrade Overview](supremm-upgrade-overview.md) is the starting point for an upgrade of an
existing instance.
